Dear Hiring Manager, 

I write to introduce myself as an interested candidate for your available Data Scienctist position. I think Infosys provides an exciting and challenging opportunity for me to step outside of political science and expand my skill set in my real passion: data science. 

In my coursework at the University of Iowa I have focused on applied statistics to address a wide variety of problems posed by observational data: time series, spatial, network, survival, and multi-level analysis. In each of these settings I have found myself deeply intrigued in the story the methods and data have to tell together about the world. As a result, I am moving forward in this vein using machine learning in my dissertation and looking to leave academia to pursue data science outside of academia. 

I am proficient in R and Stata, and I am improving my ability to use Python and SQL with freely available online materials and working on my own and collaborative projects. In addition to these abilities, I think joining your data science team gives me a great opportunity to grow and learn about these software and the methods implemented therein.


I thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to an opportunity to learn more about the position and the work done at Infosys. 


Sincerely,  
Christopher Junk
